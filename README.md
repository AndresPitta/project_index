## Academic projects

1. **Date of project: December 2019** [Accidental Overdose Deaths Dashboard](https://dsci532-milestone4-group113.herokuapp.com/): From 2012 to 2018, 5078 deaths occurred due to accidental overdose in Connecticut. In order to understand this problem better, me, Hanying Zhang [(@HanyingZhang)](https://github.com/HanyingZhang) and Mohammed Salama [(@dataubc)](https://github.com/dataubc) created this Dash dashboard with information about the drugs that caused the overdose and the victims. The repo link is [here](https://github.com/AndresPitta/DSCI_532_Group_113_Overdose_R).

2. **Date of project: January 2020** [Used cars market price prediction](https://github.com/AndresPitta/DSCI_522_Group-308_Used-Cars): Using Austin Reese's [Used vehicles price](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data), me, Serg Pokrovskyy [(@pokrovskyy)](https://github.com/pokrovskyy), Braden Tam [(@bradentam)](https://github.com/bradentam) built a model to predict a used car market price. This model works as a useful tool for both the seller and the buyer to set/accept a market price for a given vehicle. This project was done using **Docker** to ensure reproducibility.

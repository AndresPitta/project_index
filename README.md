1. [Accidental Overdose Deaths Dashboard](https://dsci532-milestone4-group113.herokuapp.com/): From 2012 to 2018, 5078 deaths occurred due to accidental overdose in Connecticut. In order to understand this problem better, me, Hanying Zhang [(@HanyingZhang)](https://github.com/HanyingZhang) and Mohammed Salama [@dataubc](https://github.com/dataubc) created this dashboard with information about the drugs that caused the overdose and the victims.
